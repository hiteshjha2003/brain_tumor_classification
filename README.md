## Abstract

Brain tumors are among the most aggressive diseases affecting both children and adults. They account for **85–90% of all primary Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors**. Every year, approximately **11,700 people** are diagnosed with brain tumors, with a **5-year survival rate of \~34% for men and 36% for women**.

Brain tumors are categorized as:

* **Benign Tumors**
* **Malignant Tumors**
* **Pituitary Tumors**, etc.

Accurate diagnostics, proper treatment planning, and timely intervention are critical to improving patient life expectancy. **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)** is the preferred method for detecting brain tumors. However, manual examination of MRI scans is often **error-prone** due to the complexity of tumors.

Automated classification using **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** has demonstrated higher accuracy than manual methods. This project proposes a system that detects and classifies brain tumors using **CNN, ANN, and Transfer Learning**, aiding doctors worldwide in fast and accurate diagnosis.

## Context

* Brain tumors vary significantly in **size, shape, and location**, making analysis difficult.
* MRI interpretation requires experienced **Neurosurgeons**, often unavailable in developing countries.
* Lack of skilled professionals leads to **time-consuming and error-prone analysis**.
* A **cloud-based automated system** can provide reliable tumor detection, classification, and segmentation, improving efficiency in medical diagnostics.

## Features

1. **Automated Tumor Detection**

   * Detect brain tumors in MRI scans with high accuracy.
2. **Tumor Classification**
